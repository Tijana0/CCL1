13.01: 
Today I did the first basic elements for my game. I added a simple track with four lanes, for now it's only a grey background with white lines deviding the lanes, and a added an example car until I draw the final one. I also added functunality on click, so the car can moves left and right if the corresponding buttons are clicked.

14.01:
I drew cars for my game, and made the road lines move from top to the bottom of the screen so that it gives an illusion of the car moving. And, I made the driver car strat outside of the canvas frame, and movie into the frame once the game starts.

15.01:
I spent a lot of time today drawing the explosion animation, which will appear when the player collides with another car. I also added other cars randomly placed along the tracks.

16.01:
Today I implemented a "Nitro Boost" feature, which, like the name says, gives the player car a boost, or in other words, speeds it up for a few seconds. I also added a start page at the begining of the game, and I drew another animation, this one for the coins that will be scattered over the tracks for the player to collect.

17.01:
I drew the track, or more specifically, the area beside the road. I also fixed a bug I had with nitro boost, which wasn't working properly, and I implemented the coin spritesheet into the code.

20.01:
Initially I made everything speed up during nitro boost, but then I realized that the other random cars shouldn't change their speed, so today I fixed that. I also added the final-score / play-again screen. And, I implemented collision detection between the player car and random cars.

21.01:
I fixed the nitro botton, or hid it, since it was always visible, so I made it only appear during the game screen, and not on the start screen. I also implemented the explosion spritesheet today. And, I fixed a few more things that weren't quite right.

22.01:
Today I did the final touches on my game, including fixing a few small things, and some minor adjustments/changes.

23.01: 
I finished my game yesterday, so today I prepared for tomorrows presentation.

24.01:
Presentation day!
